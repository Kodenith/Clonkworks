Use the grappling hook to overcome canyons or reach higher places. After throwing you can climb up the rope. 'Dig double' für shaking free and pulling back the hook.

Pay attention if pulling back the heavy hook. It easily can hurt the clonk.

The length of the hook's rope gets longer the more powerful it's material is. Worse material power means shorter rope.
