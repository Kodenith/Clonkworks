EngiClonk is a mod for [LegacyClonk](https://github.com/legacyclonk/LegacyClonk), that plans on expanding cave exploration and mining, by adding new things to find and use in caves alongside adding some new tools, utilities, and more..! 
currently, the mod has a new crafting system - "Forging", which lets you choose a metal and craft anything out of it. And also Bumbs, which are plump bees that make huge hives in caves.

Planned Features:

* Logic Gate Systems
* Ropes
* New Tools (Mining drill, launchpads, etc.)
* New Magic Spells
* New Environment Effects
* Better Mining and Cave Exploration
* 3 new clonk types
